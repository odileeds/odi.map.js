# odi.map.js

At ODI Leeds we often use the excellent [Leaflet Javascript library](https://leafletjs.com/) to make interactive maps. Leaflet is fully featured and very powerful. However it has also increased in size over the years so this is an attempt at something much smaller for more basic use-cases. We've tried to make the syntax very similar to Leaflet's so that, once a project starts to grow in complexity, it should be relatively easy to switch to Leaflet.
